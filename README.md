# National Library Programming Exercise

## Executing
Run stand-alone Spring Boot application:

`(cd backend && ../mvnw spring-boot:run)`

## GitHub repository

https://github.com/samco/spring-boot-vuejs.git

## Background

I have cheated very badly by starting from the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/jonashackt/spring-boot-vuejs`.
This allows me to avoid the uninteresting and low value plumbing work and instead
proceed to solving the high value business problems.

The git history will make clear what work is mine and what was part of the starting project.
